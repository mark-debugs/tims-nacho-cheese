Last month I loaded up the van with surfboards, a cooler full of cheese samples, and headed south on the Pacific Coast Highway. No plan, no schedule, just waves and vibes.

## Day 1: Santa Cruz

Started at Steamer Lane at dawn. The water was cold but the waves were clean. Met a crew of locals who'd never heard of artisan nacho cheese — by the end of the session, they were converted. Left them with a jar of Orange Cheese with Spice and my number.

## Day 2-3: Big Sur

Drove through Big Sur and just... stopped. Parked the van at a pullout with a view that makes you question why anyone lives inland. Made nachos on my camp stove overlooking the Pacific. If there's a better dinner spot on Earth, I haven't found it.

## Day 4: Morro Bay

Pulled into Morro Bay for supplies and ended up spending two days. Found a taco truck that was interested in carrying Tim's cheese. That's how business happens on the coast — no meetings, no pitch decks, just good food and a handshake.

## Day 5-6: Santa Barbara to Ventura

The surf at Rincon was pumping. Spent two days there, eating nachos out of the van between sessions. A photographer from a surf magazine shot some photos — might end up in their next issue. We'll see.

## The Takeaway

The best things in life happen when you stop planning and start moving. That's true for surfing, for cheese, and for pretty much everything else. Stay stoked, friends.
