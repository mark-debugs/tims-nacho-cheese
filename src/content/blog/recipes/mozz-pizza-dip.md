Pizza meets nacho cheese in the crossover nobody asked for but everyone needed.

## Why This Works

Mozz Pure is already silky and stretchy. When you bake it with marinara, it creates this incredible layered dip that's part pizza, part fondue, part life-changing experience.

## The Stretch Test

You know it's done right when you pull a piece of garlic bread away and the cheese stretches at least 6 inches. Anything less and you need more Mozz Pure. Tim's rules.

## Variations

- **Meat lover**: Add mini pepperoni on top before baking
- **Veggie**: Layer sliced mushrooms and bell peppers under the cheese
- **Mega mode**: Add a layer of Tim's MEGA SPICE underneath for a surprise kick
