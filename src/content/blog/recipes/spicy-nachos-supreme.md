This is the nacho recipe that started it all. Tim perfected this during late nights in his Venice Beach apartment, and it's been the go-to ever since.

## The Secret

The key isn't just the cheese (though obviously, Tim's Orange Cheese with Spice is non-negotiable). It's the **layering technique**. You want cheese touching every single chip. No naked nachos allowed.

## Tim's Pro Tips

- **Double layer**: Put down chips, cheese, toppings, then ANOTHER layer of chips and cheese on top. More surface area = more cheese contact.
- **Warm the cheese first**: Room temp cheese is fine, but gently warmed cheese flows into every crevice.
- **Don't overload the toppings**: The cheese is the star. Let it shine.
- **Eat from the outside in**: The edge chips are the crispiest. Save the center (maximum cheese zone) for last.

## Pair It With

A cold beer, good friends, and Tim's Surf Trip playlist on the speakers. West coast vibes mandatory.
