This is the nacho recipe that started it all. Tim perfected this during late nights in his Venice Beach apartment, and it's been the go-to ever since.

## The Secret

The key isn't just the cheese (though obviously, Tim's Orange Cheese with Spice is non-negotiable). It's the **layering technique**. You want cheese touching every single chip. No naked nachos allowed.

## Tim's Pro Tips

- **Double layer**: Put down chips, cheese, toppings, then ANOTHER layer of chips and cheese on top. More surface area = more cheese contact.
- **Warm the cheese first**: Room temp cheese is fine, but gently warmed cheese flows into every crevice.
- **Don't overload the toppings**: The cheese is the star. Let it shine.
- **Eat from the outside in**: The edge chips are the crispiest. Save the center (maximum cheese zone) for last.

## Pair It With

A cold beer, good friends, and Tim's Surf Trip playlist on the speakers. West coast vibes mandatory.

Pizza meets nacho cheese in the crossover nobody asked for but everyone needed.

## Why This Works

Mozz Pure is already silky and stretchy. When you bake it with marinara, it creates this incredible layered dip that's part pizza, part fondue, part life-changing experience.

## The Stretch Test

You know it's done right when you pull a piece of garlic bread away and the cheese stretches at least 6 inches. Anything less and you need more Mozz Pure. Tim's rules.

## Variations

- **Meat lover**: Add mini pepperoni on top before baking
- **Veggie**: Layer sliced mushrooms and bell peppers under the cheese
- **Mega mode**: Add a layer of Tim's MEGA SPICE underneath for a surprise kick

title: "Tim's Epic Surf Trip Down the PCH"
slug: "tims-surf-trip"
date: "2026-01-08"
excerpt: "Last month I loaded up the van with boards, cheese, and good vibes for a solo mission down Highway 1."
category: "lifestyle"
published: true
emoji: "🌊"
---

Last month I loaded up the van with surfboards, a cooler full of cheese samples, and headed south on the Pacific Coast Highway. No plan, no schedule, just waves and vibes.

## Day 1: Santa Cruz

Started at Steamer Lane at dawn. The water was cold but the waves were clean. Met a crew of locals who'd never heard of artisan nacho cheese — by the end of the session, they were converted. Left them with a jar of Orange Cheese with Spice and my number.

## Day 2-3: Big Sur

Drove through Big Sur and just... stopped. Parked the van at a pullout with a view that makes you question why anyone lives inland. Made nachos on my camp stove overlooking the Pacific. If there's a better dinner spot on Earth, I haven't found it.

## Day 4: Morro Bay

Pulled into Morro Bay for supplies and ended up spending two days. Found a taco truck that was interested in carrying Tim's cheese. That's how business happens on the coast — no meetings, no pitch decks, just good food and a handshake.

## Day 5-6: Santa Barbara to Ventura

The surf at Rincon was pumping. Spent two days there, eating nachos out of the van between sessions. A photographer from a surf magazine shot some photos — might end up in their next issue. We'll see.

## The Takeaway

The best things in life happen when you stop planning and start moving. That's true for surfing, for cheese, and for pretty much everything else. Stay stoked, friends.

title: "How Skateboarding Influenced My Cheese Philosophy"
slug: "skate-and-cheese"
date: "2025-12-15"
excerpt: "People ask me all the time: what does skateboarding have to do with nacho cheese? Everything."
category: "lifestyle"
published: true
emoji: "🛹"
---

People ask me this question every single week. Usually at the skate park, sometimes at farmers markets, occasionally from confused investors I've turned down. The answer is always the same: everything.

## Commitment

In skating, you commit to the trick or you eat pavement. There's no half-sending a kickflip. Same with cheese — you either go all in on quality ingredients and bold flavors, or you end up making generic grocery store sauce. We committed to making something real.

## Style Over Everything

Every skater has their own style. You can spot your friends from across the park just by how they push. Tim's Nacho Cheese has style too — from the playful labels to the west coast attitude. We're not trying to look like every other condiment brand. We're trying to look like US.

## Community

Skating taught me that the best things happen in community. The session is always better with friends. Same with food — cheese is meant to be shared. That's why we sponsor local skate events and always show up with free samples.

## Falling and Getting Back Up

I've broken bones skating. I've had batches of cheese go completely wrong. The lesson is the same: get back up, figure out what went wrong, try again. MEGA SPICE took 47 attempts before we got the heat level right. Worth it.

## The Connection

At the end of the day, both skating and cheese making are about creating something that makes people stoked. When someone lands a trick they've been working on for months, that feeling is the same as when someone tries MEGA SPICE for the first time and their face lights up (right before the heat kicks in).

Stay cheesy. Stay stoked. And always wear your helmet.
```

**Step 2: Blog listing page loader (`src/routes/blog/+page.server.ts`)**

Use import.meta.glob to load all markdown posts from src/content/blog/:
```typescript
export async function load() {
  const postFiles = import.meta.glob('/src/content/blog/**/*.md', { eager: true });

  const posts = Object.entries(postFiles).map(([path, module]) => {
    const slug = path.split('/').pop()?.replace('.md', '') ?? '';
    const post = module as { metadata: Record<string, any> };
    return {
      slug,
      ...post.metadata
    };
  });

  return {
    posts: posts
      .filter((p) => p.published)
      .sort((a, b) => new Date(b.date).getTime() - new Date(a.date).getTime())
  };
}
```

**Step 3: Blog listing page (`src/routes/blog/+page.svelte`)**

Replace the current hardcoded blog page. Build a dynamic listing with:

- Import animations: bouncySpring, prefersReducedMotion, inview, cheeseStretch
- Page header: "Blog" title with animated entrance (same pattern as other pages)
- Category filter tabs: "All", "Recipes", "Lifestyle" -- use $state for active category, $derived to filter posts
- Blog post cards: For each post, display:
  - Post emoji (large, left side)
  - Date (formatted nicely)
  - Category badge (colored: nacho for recipe, blue for lifestyle)
  - Title (linked to /blog/{slug})
  - Excerpt
  - "Read More" link with arrow SVG
- Cards animate in with `use:inview` (fly up with stagger)
- Apply `use:cheeseStretch` on cards for hover bounce
- At the bottom, include the NewsletterSignup component (from Task 2)

IMPORTANT: Use `oninview_enter` (Svelte 5 syntax), NOT `on:inview_enter` (deprecated Svelte 4 syntax).

Styling should match the existing blog page aesthetic but use real data from the loader. Use Svelte 5 runes for all state.

**Step 4: Individual blog post page**

`src/routes/blog/[slug]/+page.server.ts`:
```typescript
import { error } from '@sveltejs/kit';

export async function load({ params }) {
  try {
    // Import from all possible locations
    let post;
    try {
      post = await import(`../../../../content/blog/recipes/${params.slug}.md`);
    } catch {
      post = await import(`../../../../content/blog/lifestyle/${params.slug}.md`);
    }

    return {
      content: post.default,
      metadata: post.metadata
    };
  } catch (e) {
    throw error(404, `Post "${params.slug}" not found`);
  }
}
```

`src/routes/blog/[slug]/+page.svelte`:
- Render the MDSveX content component using `{@render}` or `<svelte:component>` (MDSveX default export is a Svelte component, render it with `<svelte:component this={data.content} />`)
- Show post metadata: title, date, category badge, emoji
- For recipe posts (category === 'recipe'), show:
  - Prep time, cook time, servings info bar
  - Ingredients list (styled as a nice card)
  - Instructions list (numbered steps)
  - "Products Used" section linking to /products for each product in the products array
  - "Download Recipe Card" button that calls generateRecipeCard from pdf-generator.ts
- Back link to /blog at the top
- Style with prose classes for markdown content rendering (Tailwind typography or manual prose styling)
- Import and display NewsletterSignup at the bottom

Use inview animations for section entrances. Apply cheeseStretch on interactive elements. Use `oninview_enter` (Svelte 5), NOT `on:inview_enter`.

**PDF Generator (`src/lib/utils/pdf-generator.ts`):**

Create a utility that generates a downloadable 4x6 inch recipe card PDF using jsPDF.

```typescript
import { jsPDF } from 'jspdf';

type RecipeData = {
  title: string;
  prepTime: string;
  cookTime: string;
  servings: number;
  ingredients: string[];
  instructions: string[];
};

export function generateRecipeCard(recipe: RecipeData): void {
  const doc = new jsPDF({
    orientation: 'portrait',
    unit: 'in',
    format: [4, 6]  // 4x6 inch recipe card
  });

  const pageWidth = 4;
  const margin = 0.3;
  const contentWidth = pageWidth - margin * 2;

  // Header
  doc.setFontSize(14);
  doc.setFont('helvetica', 'bold');
  const titleLines = doc.splitTextToSize(recipe.title, contentWidth);
  doc.text(titleLines, margin, 0.4);

  // Tim's Nacho Cheese branding
  doc.setFontSize(7);
  doc.setFont('helvetica', 'italic');
  doc.text("Tim's Nacho Cheese", margin, 0.25);

  // Info bar
  let y = 0.4 + titleLines.length * 0.2 + 0.15;
  doc.setFontSize(8);
  doc.setFont('helvetica', 'normal');
  doc.text(`Prep: ${recipe.prepTime} | Cook: ${recipe.cookTime} | Serves: ${recipe.servings}`, margin, y);

  // Divider line
  y += 0.15;
  doc.setLineWidth(0.01);
  doc.line(margin, y, pageWidth - margin, y);

  // Ingredients
  y += 0.2;
  doc.setFontSize(10);
  doc.setFont('helvetica', 'bold');
  doc.text('Ingredients', margin, y);
  y += 0.15;

  doc.setFontSize(8);
  doc.setFont('helvetica', 'normal');
  recipe.ingredients.forEach((ing) => {
    const lines = doc.splitTextToSize(`- ${ing}`, contentWidth);
    doc.text(lines, margin, y);
    y += lines.length * 0.12 + 0.02;
  });

  // Instructions
  y += 0.1;
  doc.setFontSize(10);
  doc.setFont('helvetica', 'bold');
  doc.text('Instructions', margin, y);
  y += 0.15;

  doc.setFontSize(8);
  doc.setFont('helvetica', 'normal');
  recipe.instructions.forEach((step, i) => {
    const lines = doc.splitTextToSize(`${i + 1}. ${step}`, contentWidth - 0.15);
    doc.text(lines, margin + 0.15, y);
    y += lines.length * 0.12 + 0.04;
  });

  // Footer
  doc.setFontSize(6);
  doc.setFont('helvetica', 'italic');
  doc.text('timsnachocheese.com', margin, 5.85);

  // Save
  const filename = recipe.title.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z0-9]+/g, '-');
  doc.save(`${filename}-recipe-card.pdf`);
}
```

Use `doc.splitTextToSize()` for ALL text to prevent overflow (research pitfall #7).

**RecipeCard Component (`src/lib/components/RecipeCard.svelte`):**

A button component that triggers PDF download for a recipe:
```svelte
- Props: recipe data (title, prepTime, cookTime, servings, ingredients, instructions)
- Displays a styled download button: "Download Recipe Card" with a download icon
- On click, calls generateRecipeCard with the recipe data
- Styled: bg-nacho-500 text-white rounded-full px-6 py-3, hover effect with cheeseStretch
- Shows a brief "Downloading..." state while PDF generates (use $state for loading flag)
- Import is dynamic: `const { generateRecipeCard } = await import('$lib/utils/pdf-generator');` to avoid SSR issues with jsPDF (browser-only library)
```

IMPORTANT: jsPDF uses browser APIs (canvas, blob). The import MUST be dynamic and only happen on click (client-side). Do NOT import at module top level or it will break SSR.

**Newsletter Form Action (`src/routes/newsletter/+page.server.ts`):**

Create a SvelteKit form action for newsletter signup:
```typescript
import { fail } from '@sveltejs/kit';
import type { Actions } from './$types';

export const actions: Actions = {
  default: async ({ request }) => {
    const data = await request.formData();
    const email = data.get('email')?.toString().trim();

    // Validation
    if (!email) {
      return fail(400, { email: '', error: 'Email is required' });
    }

    // Basic email format check
    const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
    if (!emailRegex.test(email)) {
      return fail(400, { email, error: 'Please enter a valid email address' });
    }

    // For v1, log the email (no backend yet)
    // In production, this would call Mailchimp/Resend/etc API
    console.log(`Newsletter signup: ${email}`);

    return { success: true, email };
  }
};
```

**NewsletterSignup Component (`src/lib/components/NewsletterSignup.svelte`):**

Reusable newsletter signup form using SvelteKit's `use:enhance` with a custom callback for handling the response. This is a single clear approach -- do NOT use a custom fetch handler or bare use:enhance.

The component uses `use:enhance` with a custom callback to POST to the `/newsletter` form action and handle the response without a full page reload:

```svelte
<script>
  import { enhance } from '$app/forms';

  let email = $state('');
  let status = $state<'idle' | 'loading' | 'success' | 'error'>('idle');
  let errorMessage = $state('');
</script>

<form method="POST" action="/newsletter" use:enhance={() => {
  status = 'loading';
  return async ({ result }) => {
    if (result.type === 'success') {
      status = 'success';
      email = '';
    } else if (result.type === 'failure') {
      status = 'error';
      errorMessage = result.data?.error || 'Something went wrong';
    }
    // Do NOT call update() -- prevents full page navigation to /newsletter
  };
}}>
  <input type="email" name="email" bind:value={email} required placeholder="your@email.com" />
  <button type="submit" disabled={status === 'loading'}>
    {status === 'loading' ? 'Subscribing...' : 'Subscribe'}
  </button>
</form>
```

Key details about the `use:enhance` callback pattern:
- SvelteKit wraps action responses in `{ type: 'success'|'failure', data: {...} }` format
- When the action returns `fail(400, { error: '...' })`, the result has `type: 'failure'` and `result.data.error` contains the error message
- When the action returns `{ success: true }`, the result has `type: 'success'`
- By NOT calling `update()` inside the callback, we prevent SvelteKit from navigating to the /newsletter route -- the form stays in place on whatever page it's rendered on

Styling:
- Wrapper: gradient bg from nacho-400 to nacho-600, rounded-2xl, p-8, text-center, text-white
- Title: "Stay Cheesy" in font-display text-3xl bold
- Subtitle: "Get the latest stories, flavor drops, and west coast wisdom straight to your inbox."
- Form: max-w-md mx-auto, flex gap-2 layout
- Input: flex-1, px-4 py-3, rounded-full, text-gray-800, focus ring
- Button: px-8 py-3, bg-white text-nacho-600, rounded-full, font-bold
- Success: green checkmark + "You're in! Stay cheesy." message replaces form
- Error: red text below input showing error message

Create a `src/routes/newsletter/` directory for the form action even though we won't have a dedicated newsletter page -- the action endpoint is what matters.
