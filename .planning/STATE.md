## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- SvelteKit over Next.js/Astro — Built-in animation primitives perfect for bouncy cheese aesthetic
- Bun as runtime — Fast, native TypeScript, clean Docker setup
- Showcase-first approach — Get the vibe right before adding commerce complexity
- No CMS for v1 — Content managed in code keeps things simple
- Tailwind CSS v3 over v4 — Bun compatibility issues with v4 (01-01)
- Svelte 5 runes syntax — Modern pattern for all components (01-01)
- Baloo 2 display font — Playful, friendly font for headings (01-01)
- Multi-stage Docker build — Minimizes final image size to 155MB (01-01)
