## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| E-commerce checkout / Stripe | Focus is design and excitement first, commerce deferred |
| Admin panel / CMS | Content managed in code for v1, keeps things simple |
| User accounts / authentication | Not needed for showcase site |
| Real-time inventory display | No e-commerce system to connect to |
| Auto-playing video/audio | Annoying, kills mobile data, accessibility nightmare |
| PDF menus | Poor mobile UX, kills SEO |
| Splash page / age gate | Adds friction, users bounce |
| Complex mega-menu | Overwhelming, kills mobile UX |
